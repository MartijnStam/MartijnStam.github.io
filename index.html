<h1>Crypto 2019 Rump Session Puzzle</h1>
<p>Look at the fellows in <a href="https://MartijnStam.github.io/puzzle.pdf"> these transition slides</a>.
  They hide a plaintext, but what is it? If you are a Crypto 2019 attendee, let me know your solution to 
  potentially win a Cards against Cryptography set. (Note that there is one fix compared to the slidedeck 
  used during the rump session.) </p>
